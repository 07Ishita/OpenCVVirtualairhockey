# OpenCVVirtualairhockey
This Virtual Air Hockey project uses OpenCV and Python to create an interactive air hockey game controlled by hand gestures via computer vision. 
The game tracks hand movements using a webcam, simulates real-world physics for paddle and puck interactions, and includes customizable gameplay settings. 
It features real-time hand tracking, gesture-based controls, and accurate collision detection. 
Future improvements aim to add multiplayer support, enhanced UI, and sound effects. The project is open to contributions.
